# angular-cv

This is an example of [resumé](http://www.avizou.eu) developped in HTML5 + CSS3 (with SASS) + AngularJS. 
It features a top information block, a timeline for education and work experience, as well as horizontal and svg circular progressbars. 
It supports **multi language** thanks to Pascal Precht's [angular-translate](https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate). 

I initially made this to support my application to an MBA in Marketing of Innovative technolgies, and now want to share it here, in the hope somebody else can find it useful. 

## Make it mine!
This projet relies on npm and Bower to handle dependencies and on Grunt to automate tasks. 
Here are the steps you should follow get ready and turn this into **your** resumé : 

After cloning the repository, use `npm install` & `bower install` to download the dependencies. 

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview. 

## Special notes
I am a marketing student, **not** a developper, and this is litterally my first ever Angular project, as well as my first serious HTML + CSS website. So please be indulgent with code quality. Feel free to fork, submit issues or pull requests if you see improvements to make :)
